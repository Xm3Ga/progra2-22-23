# Description:
Here is a description of our proyect: A snail falls into a well 20 meters deep and hangs on to the wall of the well between the 10 and 20 meters below ground.
Every day he climbs some and falls a little, but he will grow more tired as the days pass which will make him climb less per day, and depending on the weather the water will be rising to catch him, also, when a car passes by the well, the snail fall some more because of the vibrations the car  generates.

Will the snail get out of the well before he dies of starvation on the fiftieth day or falls to the water due to the rain?
